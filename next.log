ðŸ“„ stdout: "hey YouTube just in case you're new here\nmy name is YK and I was formerly a\nsoftware developer at Google and now I\nwork on this YouTube channel full time\nand welcome to my data structures and\nalgorithms series number one what are\ndata structures so a one sentence\ndescription of what data structures are\nwould be that there are basically\ndifferent ways of storing data on your\ncomputer and this sentence might not be\ntoo clear right now so let me give you a\nmore concrete example here let's say you\nwant to make a system that's sort of\nlike Google Maps for your neighborhood\nnow let's say your neighborhood looks\nlike this so your home is here and\nthere's a store here and another store\nhere and so on and there are some\nstreets too so these arrows show that\nthese are one-way streets there are a\nlot of one-way streets here and so for\nexample you can go from store to store B\nbut not the other way around and all the\nother lines here there are not arrows\nshow that they are two-way streets and\nlet's say that you already have each\nplace is coordinates there are latitudes\nand longitudes stored on your computer\nlike this as you can see from this table\nyou can tell that the latitude of home\nis forty-nine point two and the\nlongitude of home is minus one hundred\ntwenty three point four and so on now\nfrom this table like information you can\ntell where each location is exactly\nwhere each point is exactly but you\ncan't tell how these locations are\nconnected with streets and where the\nstreets are exactly so you need to\nfigure a way to store that information\nsomehow on your computer and there are\nactually a few different options for\nthis one of those options will be to\nstore all possible paths in a list like\nformat so for example one of those paths\nwill be from store a to home and another\none will be home to store a and yet\nanother path will be store a to store B\nand with that method your data might\nlook like this and from this list like\ninformation you can tell that as we saw\nearlier you can go from home to store a\nand from store a to home and home\nto store B and so on but you can't go\nfrom store B to home because this is a\none-way street and so there's no path\nfrom store B to home in this list okay\nso that's just one option another option\nmight be to list each of these places\nand for each of those places just list\nall the places you can go from that\nplace and with that method your data\nmight look like this instead as you can\nsee here we have table like information\nagain where on the left hand side we\nhave all the places listed home store a\nstore B school and then intersection\nthis one right here and on the right\nhand side for each of those places we\nhave all the places you can go from\nthere so from home you can go to store a\nstore B and intersection as you can see\nhere and from store a you can go to home\nor store B so these two methods are\nbasically two different ways of storing\nexactly the same set of data and as you\ncan see they have sort of different\nstructures and so these are simplified\nexamples of what data structures look\nlike now if you're already familiar with\ndata structures you might notice that\nthe first method corresponds to the\narray or a list data structure and the\nsecond method corresponds to the hash\ntable or hash map data structure okay so\nthat's one simple example of what data\nstructures are but this video series is\ncalled data structures and algorithms so\nwhat are algorithms one way to define\nwhat they are would be that there are\nthe operations we can perform on\ndifferent data structures and the sets\nof instructions for executing them so\none example here might be something like\nthis coming back to the previous example\nwe had let's say you want to find the\nshortest path from home to school so in\nthis problem by hand is pretty easy\npretty much right away you can see that\nthere are three potential paths from\nhome to school one of them is this one\njust go to store a store B and then\nschool another one is this one store B\nand this\ncool and another one the other one is\nfrom home to intersection to school and\nfor these three paths just compare the\ndistance that you need to travel for\neach of these paths and then pick the\nshortest one and to compute the distance\nthat you need to travel for each of\nthese paths you can for example use the\nlongitudes and latitudes the coordinates\nof each of these places and find the\ndistance in kilometers so solving this\nproblem by hand is pretty much trivial\nbut if you want to turn this into\nsomething a computer can understand you\nneed to be much more systematic about it\nso to make this strategy something a\ncomputer can understand easily you might\ncome up with a set of instructions like\nthis one first of all find all the\nplaces you can go from home so in this\nexample that's store a store B and then\nthe intersection and then from each of\nthose places find all the paths you can\ntake from that place so from store a you\ncan go to store B and from store B you\ncan go to school and from intersection\nyou can only go to school and as you go\nkeep track of the distance you've\ntraveled so far for each of those paths\nand keep repeating this process until\nyou get to the school then if you happen\nto find multiple paths that allows you\nto go from home to school then compare\nthe distance that you've traveled for\neach of those paths and finally find a\npath with the shortest distance traveled\nand then pick that as the shortest path\nokay so that's the result we were\nlooking for in the first place and this\nis a good example of what an algorithm\nis basically you have a problem you're\ngoing to solve in this case finding the\nshortest path from home to school and\nthen you have a set of systematic\ninstructions for solving that problem\nnow one thing to note here is that\ndepending on what data structure you're\nusing to store the data that you're\nperforming the algorithm on your\nalgorithm might look slightly\ndifferently you might even have in some\ncases completely different algorithms\nfor solving the same problem depending\non what data structure you're using\nin this particular example we talked\nabout two different options for storing\nthe information about where the streets\nare and how they connect different\nlocations the first option was to just\nlist all possible paths and remember\nthat the first step in our algorithm was\nto find all the possible places you can\ngo from home and to do that with the\nfirst stair structure this one right\nhere you might actually need to go\nthrough the entire list because in this\nparticular list we have three paths here\nfrom home but it's possible that we have\nanother path from home right here at the\nend of the list so you need to go\nthrough the entire list just in case on\nthe other hand if you use the second\ndata structure that we discussed we have\nall the possible places you can go from\nhome listed right here as a group so as\nsoon as we find the home row in this\ntable you won't need to go through the\nentire table anymore so in this\nparticular example using the second\nstructure actually makes it slightly\neasier to implement the algorithm that\nwe discussed now there are structures\nand algorithms are really important to\nlearn because they'll help you write\nefficient software as a software\ndeveloper so for example when I was\nworking at Microsoft as a data science\nintern I had to write this piece of code\nto retrieve some data and when I wrote\nit originally it was taking like seven\nto ten hours and basically it was too\nslow because we didn't want we didn't\nwant to wait that long so I rewrote it\nusing my knowledge of data structures\nand algorithms and after rewriting it\nthe new version only took like five to\nten minutes to load that data so that's\nwhy learning them is important and it's\nactually useful in many practical\nsituations that you might encounter as a\nsoftware developer - okay to give you an\neven better idea about what data\nstructures are like let me give you\nanother example here let's say you're\nhosting a party and you're expecting a\nbunch of people and this example is\ngonna be a little bit silly but just\nfollow along and you're gonna see why\nI'm talking about this particular\nexample anyway let's say that each\nperson\ncome to the party we'll bring sort of\nlike a small ball with them like a ball\nthat can fit in their hand and this ball\nwill have their name written on it so\nwhen David comes to the party he'll have\na ball with David written on it and when\nKevin arrives to the party he'll have a\nball with Kevin written on it and so on\nand this is just a silly little system\nthat you came up with for keeping track\nof who came to the party in which order\nbecause writing now each person's name\nwould be a lot of work you're just too\nbusy hosting a party so as someone who's\nstudying computer science let's say\nyou're trying to come up with an\nefficient system for storing these balls\nso that you can keep track of who came\nto the party one idea you have is this\none you get a very long box with 100\npartitions a lot of partitions and each\npartition let's say has exactly the same\nshape you know 10 centimeters by 10\ncentimeters let's say and every time\nsomeone comes to the party you're just\ngonna put that person's ball with their\nname written on it in the order they\ncame to the party so David's ball will\ncome in here and Kevin's will come in\nhere and so on and this is actually sort\nof like a data structure that's realized\nin real life and this actually\ncorresponds to the data structure called\narray in computer science and here's\nanother idea you have you get a bunch of\nboxes and this time instead of getting a\nlong box with many many partitions you\nwant to get individual boxes that are\nconnected with strings so the first box\nis connected to the second box with a\nstring and that's connected to the third\nbox with a string and so on and just\nlike before you want to put these tokens\nwith participants names written on them\nin these boxes just one by one in the\norder they came in so David's token will\ncome in here and Kevin's ball will come\nin here and so on and this sort of data\nstructure that's realized in real life\ncorresponds to the linked list data\nstructure in computer science okay so\nthe natural question here would be which\ndata structure\nuse for this party well it actually\ndepends because it highly depends on the\nparticular situation and the nature of\nthe party really and each data structure\nhas advantages and disadvantages okay\nthink about this situation let's say 100\npeople showed up to your party and\nyou're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly you realize that the 98th\nperson is Paul had been misspelled that\nperson's name had been misspelled so you\nwant to fix that with the array data\nstructure it's actually pretty easy you\njust need to find the 98th partition and\nthat exact location can be calculated\neasily because you know that each\npartition is ten centimeters wide so you\njust need to find ten centimeters times\nninety seven actually which is nine\nhundred seventy centimeters so you just\nneed to walk over from the beginning\nnine hundred seventy centimeters and\nthen you can find the 98th person's\ntoken pretty easily you just need to\nreplace that with the correct token with\nthe link list data structure though\ndoing the same thing would be slightly\nmore tricky and that's because finding\nthe 98th person or finding the 98th box\nhere would be much harder and the reason\nfor that is because these strings are\npretty soft and they can be pretty much\nany lengths so each box can be in any\nlocation relative to the previous box so\nthis first box might be in the living\nroom and the second box might be in the\nkitchen and so on so to find in 98th box\nwhat you need to do is you need to count\nthem one by one so you need to say okay\nthis is the first box and then this is\nthe second box and let's find the third\nbox fourth and so on until you get to\nthe 98th person at this point you might\nsay well the array data structure is a\nbetter one then well not necessarily so\nthink about this situation let's say you\nhave 100 people showing up to the party\nand you're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly five more people show up that\nyou didn't expect with the linked list\ndata structure it's pretty easy to deal\nwith that you can just\nadd five more boxes find five more boxes\nsomewhere and then five more strings and\njust add them to the last box you had in\nthe linked list data structure and then\nstore the five people's tokens in those\nboxes with the array data structure\nthough it's a little bit more tricky one\noption here would be to get another box\nwith let's say 100 partitions again and\nstore those people's tokens there and\nuse the two boxes together or you could\ndestroy the first box you had and then\nget a box with even more partitions\nlet's say 200 partitions and then\ntransfer all the balls you had for the\nfirst 100 people to the new box and then\nafter that add the additional five\npeople's tokens in the new box and in\ngeneral if you have no idea how many\npeople are coming to the party let's say\nanywhere between 5 to 1,000 people\nthe linked list data structure might be\nslightly more convenient than the array\nbecause linked lists are so much easier\nto resize than it is to resize a race ok\nand this was another simplified example\nof what data structures are like on a\ncomputer and this sort of gives you a\nrough idea about how to actually start\nthinking about them and throughout this\ncourse I'm going to introduce you to\neven more data structures and this time\nI'm going to explain them in a much more\ntechnical way using concepts like\nclasses objects memory and maybe even\nsome code snippets too now if you're\njust getting started with data\nstructures and algorithms one thing to\nkeep in mind that's actually really\nimportant is to apply what you've\nlearned through solving problems and the\nreason I say that is because it's so\ncommon for beginners to learn these\nconcepts and not actually be able to use\nthem in a real-world situation because\nthey haven't had enough practice and\nactually this video sponsor brilliant\norg has an interesting website for\nlearning these concepts in a sort of a\nnew way ok to show you what I mean let's\ntake a look at their computer science\nfundamentals course right\nhere which I would recommend for you\nguys and let's go into the intro to\nalgorithms section and you can see that\nit covers topics like arrays searching\ninsertion sort and Big O notation and in\nthe arrays section they have a bunch of\nexplanations about the topic and as you\ncontinue you'll give you a quiz to test\nyour understanding of the topic so it's\ndefinitely an interesting way to learn\ncomputer science concepts by solving\nproblems okay if you want to check it\nout for yourself just go to brilliant\norg slash CS no joke\nand going to this link will actually\nhelp support this channel and the first\n200 people will get 20% off the annual\nsubscription and actually I'm super\nexcited about this because they're the\nfirst sponsor I have on this YouTube\nchannel and I feel like I'm becoming a\nprofessional youtuber finally so thanks\nfor that brilliant ok as always I'm YK\nfrom CS dojo thanks for watching and\nI'll see you guys in the next video"

Prompt generated: Generate notes for the following transcript in points: hey YouTube just in case you're new here
my name is YK and I was formerly a
software developer at Google and now I
work on this YouTube channel full time
and welcome to my data structures and
algorithms series number one what are
data structures so a one sentence
description of what data structures are
would be that there are basically
different ways of storing data on your
computer and this sentence might not be
too clear right now so let me give you a
more concrete example here let's say you
want to make a system that's sort of
like Google Maps for your neighborhood
now let's say your neighborhood looks
like this so your home is here and
there's a store here and another store
here and so on and there are some
streets too so these arrows show that
these are one-way streets there are a
lot of one-way streets here and so for
example you can go from store to store B
but not the other way around and all the
other lines here there are not arrows
show that they are two-way streets and
let's say that you already have each
place is coordinates there are latitudes
and longitudes stored on your computer
like this as you can see from this table
you can tell that the latitude of home
is forty-nine point two and the
longitude of home is minus one hundred
twenty three point four and so on now
from this table like information you can
tell where each location is exactly
where each point is exactly but you
can't tell how these locations are
connected with streets and where the
streets are exactly so you need to
figure a way to store that information
somehow on your computer and there are
actually a few different options for
this one of those options will be to
store all possible paths in a list like
format so for example one of those paths
will be from store a to home and another
one will be home to store a and yet
another path will be store a to store B
and with that method your data might
look like this and from this list like
information you can tell that as we saw
earlier you can go from home to store a
and from store a to home and home
to store B and so on but you can't go
from store B to home because this is a
one-way street and so there's no path
from store B to home in this list okay
so that's just one option another option
might be to list each of these places
and for each of those places just list
all the places you can go from that
place and with that method your data
might look like this instead as you can
see here we have table like information
again where on the left hand side we
have all the places listed home store a
store B school and then intersection
this one right here and on the right
hand side for each of those places we
have all the places you can go from
there so from home you can go to store a
store B and intersection as you can see
here and from store a you can go to home
or store B so these two methods are
basically two different ways of storing
exactly the same set of data and as you
can see they have sort of different
structures and so these are simplified
examples of what data structures look
like now if you're already familiar with
data structures you might notice that
the first method corresponds to the
array or a list data structure and the
second method corresponds to the hash
table or hash map data structure okay so
that's one simple example of what data
structures are but this video series is
called data structures and algorithms so
what are algorithms one way to define
what they are would be that there are
the operations we can perform on
different data structures and the sets
of instructions for executing them so
one example here might be something like
this coming back to the previous example
we had let's say you want to find the
shortest path from home to school so in
this problem by hand is pretty easy
pretty much right away you can see that
there are three potential paths from
home to school one of them is this one
just go to store a store B and then
school another one is this one store B
and this
cool and another one the other one is
from home to intersection to school and
for these three paths just compare the
distance that you need to travel for
each of these paths and then pick the
shortest one and to compute the distance
that you need to travel for each of
these paths you can for example use the
longitudes and latitudes the coordinates
of each of these places and find the
distance in kilometers so solving this
problem by hand is pretty much trivial
but if you want to turn this into
something a computer can understand you
need to be much more systematic about it
so to make this strategy something a
computer can understand easily you might
come up with a set of instructions like
this one first of all find all the
places you can go from home so in this
example that's store a store B and then
the intersection and then from each of
those places find all the paths you can
take from that place so from store a you
can go to store B and from store B you
can go to school and from intersection
you can only go to school and as you go
keep track of the distance you've
traveled so far for each of those paths
and keep repeating this process until
you get to the school then if you happen
to find multiple paths that allows you
to go from home to school then compare
the distance that you've traveled for
each of those paths and finally find a
path with the shortest distance traveled
and then pick that as the shortest path
okay so that's the result we were
looking for in the first place and this
is a good example of what an algorithm
is basically you have a problem you're
going to solve in this case finding the
shortest path from home to school and
then you have a set of systematic
instructions for solving that problem
now one thing to note here is that
depending on what data structure you're
using to store the data that you're
performing the algorithm on your
algorithm might look slightly
differently you might even have in some
cases completely different algorithms
for solving the same problem depending
on what data structure you're using
in this particular example we talked
about two different options for storing
the information about where the streets
are and how they connect different
locations the first option was to just
list all possible paths and remember
that the first step in our algorithm was
to find all the possible places you can
go from home and to do that with the
first stair structure this one right
here you might actually need to go
through the entire list because in this
particular list we have three paths here
from home but it's possible that we have
another path from home right here at the
end of the list so you need to go
through the entire list just in case on
the other hand if you use the second
data structure that we discussed we have
all the possible places you can go from
home listed right here as a group so as
soon as we find the home row in this
table you won't need to go through the
entire table anymore so in this
particular example using the second
structure actually makes it slightly
easier to implement the algorithm that
we discussed now there are structures
and algorithms are really important to
learn because they'll help you write
efficient software as a software
developer so for example when I was
working at Microsoft as a data science
intern I had to write this piece of code
to retrieve some data and when I wrote
it originally it was taking like seven
to ten hours and basically it was too
slow because we didn't want we didn't
want to wait that long so I rewrote it
using my knowledge of data structures
and algorithms and after rewriting it
the new version only took like five to
ten minutes to load that data so that's
why learning them is important and it's
actually useful in many practical
situations that you might encounter as a
software developer - okay to give you an
even better idea about what data
structures are like let me give you
another example here let's say you're
hosting a party and you're expecting a
bunch of people and this example is
gonna be a little bit silly but just
follow along and you're gonna see why
I'm talking about this particular
example anyway let's say that each
person
come to the party we'll bring sort of
like a small ball with them like a ball
that can fit in their hand and this ball
will have their name written on it so
when David comes to the party he'll have
a ball with David written on it and when
Kevin arrives to the party he'll have a
ball with Kevin written on it and so on
and this is just a silly little system
that you came up with for keeping track
of who came to the party in which order
because writing now each person's name
would be a lot of work you're just too
busy hosting a party so as someone who's
studying computer science let's say
you're trying to come up with an
efficient system for storing these balls
so that you can keep track of who came
to the party one idea you have is this
one you get a very long box with 100
partitions a lot of partitions and each
partition let's say has exactly the same
shape you know 10 centimeters by 10
centimeters let's say and every time
someone comes to the party you're just
gonna put that person's ball with their
name written on it in the order they
came to the party so David's ball will
come in here and Kevin's will come in
here and so on and this is actually sort
of like a data structure that's realized
in real life and this actually
corresponds to the data structure called
array in computer science and here's
another idea you have you get a bunch of
boxes and this time instead of getting a
long box with many many partitions you
want to get individual boxes that are
connected with strings so the first box
is connected to the second box with a
string and that's connected to the third
box with a string and so on and just
like before you want to put these tokens
with participants names written on them
in these boxes just one by one in the
order they came in so David's token will
come in here and Kevin's ball will come
in here and so on and this sort of data
structure that's realized in real life
corresponds to the linked list data
structure in computer science okay so
the natural question here would be which
data structure
use for this party well it actually
depends because it highly depends on the
particular situation and the nature of
the party really and each data structure
has advantages and disadvantages okay
think about this situation let's say 100
people showed up to your party and
you're pretty happy about it but
suddenly you realize that the 98th
person is Paul had been misspelled that
person's name had been misspelled so you
want to fix that with the array data
structure it's actually pretty easy you
just need to find the 98th partition and
that exact location can be calculated
easily because you know that each
partition is ten centimeters wide so you
just need to find ten centimeters times
ninety seven actually which is nine
hundred seventy centimeters so you just
need to walk over from the beginning
nine hundred seventy centimeters and
then you can find the 98th person's
token pretty easily you just need to
replace that with the correct token with
the link list data structure though
doing the same thing would be slightly
more tricky and that's because finding
the 98th person or finding the 98th box
here would be much harder and the reason
for that is because these strings are
pretty soft and they can be pretty much
any lengths so each box can be in any
location relative to the previous box so
this first box might be in the living
room and the second box might be in the
kitchen and so on so to find in 98th box
what you need to do is you need to count
them one by one so you need to say okay
this is the first box and then this is
the second box and let's find the third
box fourth and so on until you get to
the 98th person at this point you might
say well the array data structure is a
better one then well not necessarily so
think about this situation let's say you
have 100 people showing up to the party
and you're pretty happy about it but
suddenly five more people show up that
you didn't expect with the linked list
data structure it's pretty easy to deal
with that you can just
add five more boxes find five more boxes
somewhere and then five more strings and
just add them to the last box you had in
the linked list data structure and then
store the five people's tokens in those
boxes with the array data structure
though it's a little bit more tricky one
option here would be to get another box
with let's say 100 partitions again and
store those people's tokens there and
use the two boxes together or you could
destroy the first box you had and then
get a box with even more partitions
let's say 200 partitions and then
transfer all the balls you had for the
first 100 people to the new box and then
after that add the additional five
people's tokens in the new box and in
general if you have no idea how many
people are coming to the party let's say
anywhere between 5 to 1,000 people
the linked list data structure might be
slightly more convenient than the array
because linked lists are so much easier
to resize than it is to resize a race ok
and this was another simplified example
of what data structures are like on a
computer and this sort of gives you a
rough idea about how to actually start
thinking about them and throughout this
course I'm going to introduce you to
even more data structures and this time
I'm going to explain them in a much more
technical way using concepts like
classes objects memory and maybe even
some code snippets too now if you're
just getting started with data
structures and algorithms one thing to
keep in mind that's actually really
important is to apply what you've
learned through solving problems and the
reason I say that is because it's so
common for beginners to learn these
concepts and not actually be able to use
them in a real-world situation because
they haven't had enough practice and
actually this video sponsor brilliant
org has an interesting website for
learning these concepts in a sort of a
new way ok to show you what I mean let's
take a look at their computer science
fundamentals course right
here which I would recommend for you
guys and let's go into the intro to
algorithms section and you can see that
it covers topics like arrays searching
insertion sort and Big O notation and in
the arrays section they have a bunch of
explanations about the topic and as you
continue you'll give you a quiz to test
your understanding of the topic so it's
definitely an interesting way to learn
computer science concepts by solving
problems okay if you want to check it
out for yourself just go to brilliant
org slash CS no joke

help support this channel and the first
200 people will get 20% off the annual

excited about this because they're the
first sponsor I have on this YouTube
channel and I feel like I'm becoming a

ðŸ“„ stdout: "hey YouTube just in case you're new here\nmy name is YK and I was formerly a\nsoftware developer at Google and now I\nwork on this YouTube channel full time\nand welcome to my data structures and\nalgorithms series number one what are\ndata structures so a one sentence\ndescription of what data structures are\nwould be that there are basically\ndifferent ways of storing data on your\ncomputer and this sentence might not be\ntoo clear right now so let me give you a\nmore concrete example here let's say you\nwant to make a system that's sort of\nlike Google Maps for your neighborhood\nnow let's say your neighborhood looks\nlike this so your home is here and\nthere's a store here and another store\nhere and so on and there are some\nstreets too so these arrows show that\nthese are one-way streets there are a\nlot of one-way streets here and so for\nexample you can go from store to store B\nbut not the other way around and all the\nother lines here there are not arrows\nshow that they are two-way streets and\nlet's say that you already have each\nplace is coordinates there are latitudes\nand longitudes stored on your computer\nlike this as you can see from this table\nyou can tell that the latitude of home\nis forty-nine point two and the\nlongitude of home is minus one hundred\ntwenty three point four and so on now\nfrom this table like information you can\ntell where each location is exactly\nwhere each point is exactly but you\ncan't tell how these locations are\nconnected with streets and where the\nstreets are exactly so you need to\nfigure a way to store that information\nsomehow on your computer and there are\nactually a few different options for\nthis one of those options will be to\nstore all possible paths in a list like\nformat so for example one of those paths\nwill be from store a to home and another\none will be home to store a and yet\nanother path will be store a to store B\nand with that method your data might\nlook like this and from this list like\ninformation you can tell that as we saw\nearlier you can go from home to store a\nand from store a to home and home\nto store B and so on but you can't go\nfrom store B to home because this is a\none-way street and so there's no path\nfrom store B to home in this list okay\nso that's just one option another option\nmight be to list each of these places\nand for each of those places just list\nall the places you can go from that\nplace and with that method your data\nmight look like this instead as you can\nsee here we have table like information\nagain where on the left hand side we\nhave all the places listed home store a\nstore B school and then intersection\nthis one right here and on the right\nhand side for each of those places we\nhave all the places you can go from\nthere so from home you can go to store a\nstore B and intersection as you can see\nhere and from store a you can go to home\nor store B so these two methods are\nbasically two different ways of storing\nexactly the same set of data and as you\ncan see they have sort of different\nstructures and so these are simplified\nexamples of what data structures look\nlike now if you're already familiar with\ndata structures you might notice that\nthe first method corresponds to the\narray or a list data structure and the\nsecond method corresponds to the hash\ntable or hash map data structure okay so\nthat's one simple example of what data\nstructures are but this video series is\ncalled data structures and algorithms so\nwhat are algorithms one way to define\nwhat they are would be that there are\nthe operations we can perform on\ndifferent data structures and the sets\nof instructions for executing them so\none example here might be something like\nthis coming back to the previous example\nwe had let's say you want to find the\nshortest path from home to school so in\nthis problem by hand is pretty easy\npretty much right away you can see that\nthere are three potential paths from\nhome to school one of them is this one\njust go to store a store B and then\nschool another one is this one store B\nand this\ncool and another one the other one is\nfrom home to intersection to school and\nfor these three paths just compare the\ndistance that you need to travel for\neach of these paths and then pick the\nshortest one and to compute the distance\nthat you need to travel for each of\nthese paths you can for example use the\nlongitudes and latitudes the coordinates\nof each of these places and find the\ndistance in kilometers so solving this\nproblem by hand is pretty much trivial\nbut if you want to turn this into\nsomething a computer can understand you\nneed to be much more systematic about it\nso to make this strategy something a\ncomputer can understand easily you might\ncome up with a set of instructions like\nthis one first of all find all the\nplaces you can go from home so in this\nexample that's store a store B and then\nthe intersection and then from each of\nthose places find all the paths you can\ntake from that place so from store a you\ncan go to store B and from store B you\ncan go to school and from intersection\nyou can only go to school and as you go\nkeep track of the distance you've\ntraveled so far for each of those paths\nand keep repeating this process until\nyou get to the school then if you happen\nto find multiple paths that allows you\nto go from home to school then compare\nthe distance that you've traveled for\neach of those paths and finally find a\npath with the shortest distance traveled\nand then pick that as the shortest path\nokay so that's the result we were\nlooking for in the first place and this\nis a good example of what an algorithm\nis basically you have a problem you're\ngoing to solve in this case finding the\nshortest path from home to school and\nthen you have a set of systematic\ninstructions for solving that problem\nnow one thing to note here is that\ndepending on what data structure you're\nusing to store the data that you're\nperforming the algorithm on your\nalgorithm might look slightly\ndifferently you might even have in some\ncases completely different algorithms\nfor solving the same problem depending\non what data structure you're using\nin this particular example we talked\nabout two different options for storing\nthe information about where the streets\nare and how they connect different\nlocations the first option was to just\nlist all possible paths and remember\nthat the first step in our algorithm was\nto find all the possible places you can\ngo from home and to do that with the\nfirst stair structure this one right\nhere you might actually need to go\nthrough the entire list because in this\nparticular list we have three paths here\nfrom home but it's possible that we have\nanother path from home right here at the\nend of the list so you need to go\nthrough the entire list just in case on\nthe other hand if you use the second\ndata structure that we discussed we have\nall the possible places you can go from\nhome listed right here as a group so as\nsoon as we find the home row in this\ntable you won't need to go through the\nentire table anymore so in this\nparticular example using the second\nstructure actually makes it slightly\neasier to implement the algorithm that\nwe discussed now there are structures\nand algorithms are really important to\nlearn because they'll help you write\nefficient software as a software\ndeveloper so for example when I was\nworking at Microsoft as a data science\nintern I had to write this piece of code\nto retrieve some data and when I wrote\nit originally it was taking like seven\nto ten hours and basically it was too\nslow because we didn't want we didn't\nwant to wait that long so I rewrote it\nusing my knowledge of data structures\nand algorithms and after rewriting it\nthe new version only took like five to\nten minutes to load that data so that's\nwhy learning them is important and it's\nactually useful in many practical\nsituations that you might encounter as a\nsoftware developer - okay to give you an\neven better idea about what data\nstructures are like let me give you\nanother example here let's say you're\nhosting a party and you're expecting a\nbunch of people and this example is\ngonna be a little bit silly but just\nfollow along and you're gonna see why\nI'm talking about this particular\nexample anyway let's say that each\nperson\ncome to the party we'll bring sort of\nlike a small ball with them like a ball\nthat can fit in their hand and this ball\nwill have their name written on it so\nwhen David comes to the party he'll have\na ball with David written on it and when\nKevin arrives to the party he'll have a\nball with Kevin written on it and so on\nand this is just a silly little system\nthat you came up with for keeping track\nof who came to the party in which order\nbecause writing now each person's name\nwould be a lot of work you're just too\nbusy hosting a party so as someone who's\nstudying computer science let's say\nyou're trying to come up with an\nefficient system for storing these balls\nso that you can keep track of who came\nto the party one idea you have is this\none you get a very long box with 100\npartitions a lot of partitions and each\npartition let's say has exactly the same\nshape you know 10 centimeters by 10\ncentimeters let's say and every time\nsomeone comes to the party you're just\ngonna put that person's ball with their\nname written on it in the order they\ncame to the party so David's ball will\ncome in here and Kevin's will come in\nhere and so on and this is actually sort\nof like a data structure that's realized\nin real life and this actually\ncorresponds to the data structure called\narray in computer science and here's\nanother idea you have you get a bunch of\nboxes and this time instead of getting a\nlong box with many many partitions you\nwant to get individual boxes that are\nconnected with strings so the first box\nis connected to the second box with a\nstring and that's connected to the third\nbox with a string and so on and just\nlike before you want to put these tokens\nwith participants names written on them\nin these boxes just one by one in the\norder they came in so David's token will\ncome in here and Kevin's ball will come\nin here and so on and this sort of data\nstructure that's realized in real life\ncorresponds to the linked list data\nstructure in computer science okay so\nthe natural question here would be which\ndata structure\nuse for this party well it actually\ndepends because it highly depends on the\nparticular situation and the nature of\nthe party really and each data structure\nhas advantages and disadvantages okay\nthink about this situation let's say 100\npeople showed up to your party and\nyou're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly you realize that the 98th\nperson is Paul had been misspelled that\nperson's name had been misspelled so you\nwant to fix that with the array data\nstructure it's actually pretty easy you\njust need to find the 98th partition and\nthat exact location can be calculated\neasily because you know that each\npartition is ten centimeters wide so you\njust need to find ten centimeters times\nninety seven actually which is nine\nhundred seventy centimeters so you just\nneed to walk over from the beginning\nnine hundred seventy centimeters and\nthen you can find the 98th person's\ntoken pretty easily you just need to\nreplace that with the correct token with\nthe link list data structure though\ndoing the same thing would be slightly\nmore tricky and that's because finding\nthe 98th person or finding the 98th box\nhere would be much harder and the reason\nfor that is because these strings are\npretty soft and they can be pretty much\nany lengths so each box can be in any\nlocation relative to the previous box so\nthis first box might be in the living\nroom and the second box might be in the\nkitchen and so on so to find in 98th box\nwhat you need to do is you need to count\nthem one by one so you need to say okay\nthis is the first box and then this is\nthe second box and let's find the third\nbox fourth and so on until you get to\nthe 98th person at this point you might\nsay well the array data structure is a\nbetter one then well not necessarily so\nthink about this situation let's say you\nhave 100 people showing up to the party\nand you're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly five more people show up that\nyou didn't expect with the linked list\ndata structure it's pretty easy to deal\nwith that you can just\nadd five more boxes find five more boxes\nsomewhere and then five more strings and\njust add them to the last box you had in\nthe linked list data structure and then\nstore the five people's tokens in those\nboxes with the array data structure\nthough it's a little bit more tricky one\noption here would be to get another box\nwith let's say 100 partitions again and\nstore those people's tokens there and\nuse the two boxes together or you could\ndestroy the first box you had and then\nget a box with even more partitions\nlet's say 200 partitions and then\ntransfer all the balls you had for the\nfirst 100 people to the new box and then\nafter that add the additional five\npeople's tokens in the new box and in\ngeneral if you have no idea how many\npeople are coming to the party let's say\nanywhere between 5 to 1,000 people\nthe linked list data structure might be\nslightly more convenient than the array\nbecause linked lists are so much easier\nto resize than it is to resize a race ok\nand this was another simplified example\nof what data structures are like on a\ncomputer and this sort of gives you a\nrough idea about how to actually start\nthinking about them and throughout this\ncourse I'm going to introduce you to\neven more data structures and this time\nI'm going to explain them in a much more\ntechnical way using concepts like\nclasses objects memory and maybe even\nsome code snippets too now if you're\njust getting started with data\nstructures and algorithms one thing to\nkeep in mind that's actually really\nimportant is to apply what you've\nlearned through solving problems and the\nreason I say that is because it's so\ncommon for beginners to learn these\nconcepts and not actually be able to use\nthem in a real-world situation because\nthey haven't had enough practice and\nactually this video sponsor brilliant\norg has an interesting website for\nlearning these concepts in a sort of a\nnew way ok to show you what I mean let's\ntake a look at their computer science\nfundamentals course right\nhere which I would recommend for you\nguys and let's go into the intro to\nalgorithms section and you can see that\nit covers topics like arrays searching\ninsertion sort and Big O notation and in\nthe arrays section they have a bunch of\nexplanations about the topic and as you\ncontinue you'll give you a quiz to test\nyour understanding of the topic so it's\ndefinitely an interesting way to learn\ncomputer science concepts by solving\nproblems okay if you want to check it\nout for yourself just go to brilliant\norg slash CS no joke\nand going to this link will actually\nhelp support this channel and the first\n200 people will get 20% off the annual\nsubscription and actually I'm super\nexcited about this because they're the\nfirst sponsor I have on this YouTube\nchannel and I feel like I'm becoming a\nprofessional youtuber finally so thanks\nfor that brilliant ok as always I'm YK\nfrom CS dojo thanks for watching and\nI'll see you guys in the next video"

Prompt generated: Generate notes for the following transcript in points: hey YouTube just in case you're new here
my name is YK and I was formerly a
software developer at Google and now I
work on this YouTube channel full time
and welcome to my data structures and
algorithms series number one what are
data structures so a one sentence
description of what data structures are
would be that there are basically
different ways of storing data on your
computer and this sentence might not be
too clear right now so let me give you a
more concrete example here let's say you
want to make a system that's sort of
like Google Maps for your neighborhood
now let's say your neighborhood looks
like this so your home is here and
there's a store here and another store
here and so on and there are some
streets too so these arrows show that
these are one-way streets there are a
lot of one-way streets here and so for
example you can go from store to store B
but not the other way around and all the
other lines here there are not arrows
show that they are two-way streets and
let's say that you already have each
place is coordinates there are latitudes
and longitudes stored on your computer
like this as you can see from this table
you can tell that the latitude of home
is forty-nine point two and the
longitude of home is minus one hundred
twenty three point four and so on now
from this table like information you can
tell where each location is exactly
where each point is exactly but you
can't tell how these locations are
connected with streets and where the
streets are exactly so you need to
figure a way to store that information
somehow on your computer and there are
actually a few different options for
this one of those options will be to
store all possible paths in a list like
format so for example one of those paths
will be from store a to home and another
one will be home to store a and yet
another path will be store a to store B
and with that method your data might
look like this and from this list like
information you can tell that as we saw
earlier you can go from home to store a
and from store a to home and home
to store B and so on but you can't go
from store B to home because this is a
one-way street and so there's no path
from store B to home in this list okay
so that's just one option another option
might be to list each of these places
and for each of those places just list
all the places you can go from that
place and with that method your data
might look like this instead as you can
see here we have table like information
again where on the left hand side we
have all the places listed home store a
store B school and then intersection
this one right here and on the right
hand side for each of those places we
have all the places you can go from
there so from home you can go to store a
store B and intersection as you can see
here and from store a you can go to home
or store B so these two methods are
basically two different ways of storing
exactly the same set of data and as you
can see they have sort of different
structures and so these are simplified
examples of what data structures look
like now if you're already familiar with
data structures you might notice that
the first method corresponds to the
array or a list data structure and the
second method corresponds to the hash
table or hash map data structure okay so
that's one simple example of what data
structures are but this video series is
called data structures and algorithms so
what are algorithms one way to define
what they are would be that there are
the operations we can perform on
different data structures and the sets
of instructions for executing them so
one example here might be something like
this coming back to the previous example
we had let's say you want to find the
shortest path from home to school so in
this problem by hand is pretty easy
pretty much right away you can see that
there are three potential paths from
home to school one of them is this one
just go to store a store B and then
school another one is this one store B
and this
cool and another one the other one is
from home to intersection to school and
for these three paths just compare the
distance that you need to travel for
each of these paths and then pick the
shortest one and to compute the distance
that you need to travel for each of
these paths you can for example use the
longitudes and latitudes the coordinates
of each of these places and find the
distance in kilometers so solving this
problem by hand is pretty much trivial
but if you want to turn this into
something a computer can understand you
need to be much more systematic about it
so to make this strategy something a
computer can understand easily you might
come up with a set of instructions like
this one first of all find all the
places you can go from home so in this
example that's store a store B and then
the intersection and then from each of
those places find all the paths you can
take from that place so from store a you
can go to store B and from store B you
can go to school and from intersection
you can only go to school and as you go
keep track of the distance you've
traveled so far for each of those paths
and keep repeating this process until
you get to the school then if you happen
to find multiple paths that allows you
to go from home to school then compare
the distance that you've traveled for
each of those paths and finally find a
path with the shortest distance traveled
and then pick that as the shortest path
okay so that's the result we were
looking for in the first place and this
is a good example of what an algorithm
is basically you have a problem you're
going to solve in this case finding the
shortest path from home to school and
then you have a set of systematic
instructions for solving that problem
now one thing to note here is that
depending on what data structure you're
using to store the data that you're
performing the algorithm on your
algorithm might look slightly
differently you might even have in some
cases completely different algorithms
for solving the same problem depending
on what data structure you're using
in this particular example we talked
about two different options for storing
the information about where the streets
are and how they connect different
locations the first option was to just
list all possible paths and remember
that the first step in our algorithm was
to find all the possible places you can
go from home and to do that with the
first stair structure this one right
here you might actually need to go
through the entire list because in this
particular list we have three paths here
from home but it's possible that we have
another path from home right here at the
end of the list so you need to go
through the entire list just in case on
the other hand if you use the second
data structure that we discussed we have
all the possible places you can go from
home listed right here as a group so as
soon as we find the home row in this
table you won't need to go through the
entire table anymore so in this
particular example using the second
structure actually makes it slightly
easier to implement the algorithm that
we discussed now there are structures
and algorithms are really important to
learn because they'll help you write
efficient software as a software
developer so for example when I was
working at Microsoft as a data science
intern I had to write this piece of code
to retrieve some data and when I wrote
it originally it was taking like seven
to ten hours and basically it was too
slow because we didn't want we didn't
want to wait that long so I rewrote it
using my knowledge of data structures
and algorithms and after rewriting it
the new version only took like five to
ten minutes to load that data so that's
why learning them is important and it's
actually useful in many practical
situations that you might encounter as a
software developer - okay to give you an
even better idea about what data
structures are like let me give you
another example here let's say you're
hosting a party and you're expecting a
bunch of people and this example is
gonna be a little bit silly but just
follow along and you're gonna see why
I'm talking about this particular
example anyway let's say that each
person
come to the party we'll bring sort of
like a small ball with them like a ball
that can fit in their hand and this ball
will have their name written on it so
when David comes to the party he'll have
a ball with David written on it and when
Kevin arrives to the party he'll have a
ball with Kevin written on it and so on
and this is just a silly little system
that you came up with for keeping track
of who came to the party in which order
because writing now each person's name
would be a lot of work you're just too
busy hosting a party so as someone who's
studying computer science let's say
you're trying to come up with an
efficient system for storing these balls
so that you can keep track of who came
to the party one idea you have is this
one you get a very long box with 100
partitions a lot of partitions and each
partition let's say has exactly the same
shape you know 10 centimeters by 10
centimeters let's say and every time
someone comes to the party you're just
gonna put that person's ball with their
name written on it in the order they
came to the party so David's ball will
come in here and Kevin's will come in
here and so on and this is actually sort
of like a data structure that's realized
in real life and this actually
corresponds to the data structure called
array in computer science and here's
another idea you have you get a bunch of
boxes and this time instead of getting a
long box with many many partitions you
want to get individual boxes that are
connected with strings so the first box
is connected to the second box with a
string and that's connected to the third
box with a string and so on and just
like before you want to put these tokens
with participants names written on them
in these boxes just one by one in the
order they came in so David's token will
come in here and Kevin's ball will come
in here and so on and this sort of data
structure that's realized in real life
corresponds to the linked list data
structure in computer science okay so
the natural question here would be which
data structure
use for this party well it actually
depends because it highly depends on the
particular situation and the nature of
the party really and each data structure
has advantages and disadvantages okay
think about this situation let's say 100
people showed up to your party and
you're pretty happy about it but
suddenly you realize that the 98th
person is Paul had been misspelled that
person's name had been misspelled so you
want to fix that with the array data
structure it's actually pretty easy you
just need to find the 98th partition and
that exact location can be calculated
easily because you know that each
partition is ten centimeters wide so you
just need to find ten centimeters times
ninety seven actually which is nine
hundred seventy centimeters so you just
need to walk over from the beginning
nine hundred seventy centimeters and
then you can find the 98th person's
token pretty easily you just need to
replace that with the correct token with
the link list data structure though
doing the same thing would be slightly
more tricky and that's because finding
the 98th person or finding the 98th box
here would be much harder and the reason
for that is because these strings are
pretty soft and they can be pretty much
any lengths so each box can be in any
location relative to the previous box so
this first box might be in the living
room and the second box might be in the
kitchen and so on so to find in 98th box
what you need to do is you need to count
them one by one so you need to say okay
this is the first box and then this is
the second box and let's find the third
box fourth and so on until you get to
the 98th person at this point you might
say well the array data structure is a
better one then well not necessarily so
think about this situation let's say you
have 100 people showing up to the party
and you're pretty happy about it but
suddenly five more people show up that
you didn't expect with the linked list
data structure it's pretty easy to deal
with that you can just
add five more boxes find five more boxes
somewhere and then five more strings and
just add them to the last box you had in
the linked list data structure and then
store the five people's tokens in those
boxes with the array data structure
though it's a little bit more tricky one
option here would be to get another box
with let's say 100 partitions again and
store those people's tokens there and
use the two boxes together or you could
destroy the first box you had and then
get a box with even more partitions
let's say 200 partitions and then
transfer all the balls you had for the
first 100 people to the new box and then
after that add the additional five
people's tokens in the new box and in
general if you have no idea how many
people are coming to the party let's say
anywhere between 5 to 1,000 people
the linked list data structure might be
slightly more convenient than the array
because linked lists are so much easier
to resize than it is to resize a race ok
and this was another simplified example
of what data structures are like on a
computer and this sort of gives you a
rough idea about how to actually start
thinking about them and throughout this
course I'm going to introduce you to
even more data structures and this time
I'm going to explain them in a much more
technical way using concepts like
classes objects memory and maybe even
some code snippets too now if you're
just getting started with data
structures and algorithms one thing to
keep in mind that's actually really
important is to apply what you've
learned through solving problems and the
reason I say that is because it's so
common for beginners to learn these
concepts and not actually be able to use
them in a real-world situation because
they haven't had enough practice and
actually this video sponsor brilliant
org has an interesting website for
learning these concepts in a sort of a
new way ok to show you what I mean let's
take a look at their computer science
fundamentals course right
here which I would recommend for you
guys and let's go into the intro to
algorithms section and you can see that
it covers topics like arrays searching
insertion sort and Big O notation and in
the arrays section they have a bunch of
explanations about the topic and as you
continue you'll give you a quiz to test
your understanding of the topic so it's
definitely an interesting way to learn
computer science concepts by solving
problems okay if you want to check it

Extracted response text: Here are the notes from the transcript, organized into key points:

**I. Introduction**

*   YK is a former Google software developer and now a full-time YouTuber.
*   This video is the first in a data structures and algorithms series.

**II. What are Data Structures?**

*   **Definition:** Ways of storing data on your computer.
*   **Example: Google Maps for a Neighborhood:**
    *   Locations (Home, Store A, Store B, School, Intersection).
    *   Latitude and Longitude coordinates are already stored.
    *   Need to store how locations are connected by streets (including one-way streets).
*   **Two Data Structure Options:**
    *   **Option 1: List of all possible paths:** (e.g., Store A -> Home, Home -> Store A, Store A -> Store B).  Can tell direction (one-way).
    *   **Option 2: Table listing each place and the places you can go from there:** (e.g., Home -> Store A, Store B, Intersection).
*   These options demonstrate different structures for storing the same data.
*   **Connection to Known Data Structures:**
    *   Option 1 resembles an array or list.
    *   Option 2 resembles a hash table or hash map.

**III. What are Algorithms?**

*   **Definition:** Operations performed on data structures; sets of instructions for executing them.
*   **Example: Finding the Shortest Path from Home to School:**
    *   **Problem:**  Find the shortest path in the neighborhood.
    *   **Manual Solution:** Identify possible paths and compare distances.
    *   **Algorithm/Instructions for a Computer:**
        1.  Find all places you can go from Home (Store A, Store B, Intersection).
        2.  From each of those places, find all paths you can take.
        3.  Track the distance traveled for each path.
        4.  Repeat until you reach the School.
        5.  If multiple paths to school, compare distances.
        6.  Select the shortest path.
*   Algorithms depend on the data structure being used.
*   Example shows how implementation of the same algorithm changes depending on the data structure used.
    * The first path need to search entire list of paths.
    * The second path already has the list in a table so no more traversing is needed.

**IV. Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms**

*   They help you write efficient software.
*   **Real-world example:**  YK rewrote code at Microsoft using data structures and algorithms. Original code took 7-10 hours; the rewritten version took 5-10 minutes.

**V. Another Example: Party with Balls**

*   **Scenario:** Hosting a party. Guests bring balls with their names on them. Need an efficient system to store them.
*   **Data Structure 1:  Long box with partitions (Array):**
    *   Put the balls in order of arrival in the partitions.
    *   Corresponds to the array data structure.
*   **Data Structure 2:  Connected individual boxes (Linked List):**
    *   Boxes connected with strings.
    *   Put the balls in order of arrival in the boxes.
    *   Corresponds to the linked list data structure.
*   **Which Data Structure is Better? It Depends.**
*   **Scenario 1: Misspelled Name:**
    *   **Array:** Easy to find and replace because partitions are uniformly sized.
    *   **Linked List:**  Difficult to find the 98th box because the string lengths are variable, and you have to count box by box.
*   **Scenario 2: Unexpected Guests Arrive:**
    *   **Linked List:** Easy to add more boxes and connect them.
    *   **Array:** More difficult.  Need to get a larger box, transfer existing balls, and then add new ones.
*   **General Case (Variable Number of Guests):** Linked list may be more convenient because it's easier to resize than arrays.

**VI. Course Outlook and Sponsor**

*   The course will introduce more data structures with technical explanations (classes, objects, memory, code).
*   Apply what you've learned through problem-solving.
*   **Sponsor:** Brilliant.org.
    *   Recommend checking out their Computer Science Fundamentals course.
    *   Covers arrays, searching, insertion sort, Big O notation.
    *   Includes quizzes to test understanding.
*   **Promotion:**  Go to brilliant.org/CS no joke for 20% off the annual subscription (first 200 people).

**VII. Closing**

*   Thanks for watching.
*   See you in the next video.

Extracted response text: Here's a breakdown of the transcript into concise points:

**I. Introduction (0:00-0:17)**

*   YK, former Google software developer, now full-time YouTuber.
*   Starting a "Data Structures and Algorithms" series.

**II. What are Data Structures? (0:17-5:02)**

*   **Definition:** Ways of storing data on a computer.
*   **Example: Google Maps for a neighborhood.**
    *   Scenario: Storing locations (Home, Store A, Store B, School, Intersection) and streets.
    *   Locations have latitude/longitude coordinates.
    *   Need to store connection information (streets, one-way vs. two-way).
*   **Option 1: List of All Possible Paths**
    *  Lists each possible connection between any of the locations.
    *  Can be stored in a list.
    *  Can easily check one-way streets by checking if the inverse connection exists.
*   **Option 2: List of Possible Destinations**
    *   Lists each location, then lists places you can go *from* that location.
    *   Table/Hash map format.
    *   Home goes to Store A, Store B, Intersection, etc.
*   Both methods store the same data but have different structures.
*   Option 1 resembles an Array/List data structure.
*   Option 2 resembles a Hash Table/Hash Map data structure.

**III. What are Algorithms? (5:02-9:04)**

*   **Definition:** Operations performable on data structures; sets of instructions for executing them.
*   **Example: Finding the Shortest Path**
    *   Problem: Find the shortest path from Home to School.
    *   Manually, you can easily see possible paths and distances.
    *   To make this understandable for a computer, you need a systematic approach.
*   **Algorithm Instructions**
    1.  Find all places you can go from Home (Store A, Store B, Intersection).
    2.  From *those* places, find where you can go next (Store A -> Store B, Intersection -> School, etc.)
    3.  Keep track of distances.
    4.  Repeat until you reach School.
    5.  Compare the distances of all paths to School.
    6.  Choose the shortest path.
*   Algorithms depend on the data structure used; you might need a different algorithm for the same problem based on the data structure.
*   Using hash table data structure may be easier than using list data structure in this specific case.

**IV. Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms (9:04-10:02)**

*   Help write efficient software.
*   **Example:** Data science intern at Microsoft, rewrote code using knowledge of data structures, reduced execution time from 7-10 hours to 5-10 minutes.

**V. Real-World Analogy: Party with Balls (10:02-16:43)**

*   Silly scenario: Guests bring balls with their names on them to the party. Need to store them to track attendance.
*   **Option 1: Long Box with Partitions (Array)**
    *   Place balls in partitions in order of arrival.
    *   Real-life analogue of an Array.
*   **Option 2: Individual Boxes Connected by Strings (Linked List)**
    *   Place balls in individual boxes, connected in a line.
    *   Real-life analogue of a Linked List.
*   Which to use depends on the situation; each has pros/cons.
*   **Scenario 1: Misspelled Name:**
    *   **Array:** Easy to locate the partition and replace the ball.
    *   **Linked List:** Harder to find the specific box without counting from the beginning.
*   **Scenario 2: Unexpected Guests:**
    *   **Array:**  Requires finding a larger box, transferring existing balls.
    *   **Linked List:** Easier to add more boxes and strings.
*   Linked lists are easier to resize than arrays.

**VI. Conclusion and Brilliant.org Sponsor (16:43-End)**

*   Throughout the course, more data structures will be introduced in a more technical way.
*   Important to apply what you learn by solving problems.
*   Sponsor: **Brilliant.org**.
    *   Computer Science Fundamentals course recommended.
    *   Intro to algorithms section, covers arrays, searching, sorting, etc.
    *   Includes quizzes to test understanding.
    *   brilliant.org/CSnojoke - support the channel, first 200 get 20% off annual subscription.
*   YK is excited about his first sponsor.
*   Thanks for watching, see you next video.

ðŸ“„ stdout: "hey YouTube just in case you're new here\nmy name is YK and I was formerly a\nsoftware developer at Google and now I\nwork on this YouTube channel full time\nand welcome to my data structures and\nalgorithms series number one what are\ndata structures so a one sentence\ndescription of what data structures are\nwould be that there are basically\ndifferent ways of storing data on your\ncomputer and this sentence might not be\ntoo clear right now so let me give you a\nmore concrete example here let's say you\nwant to make a system that's sort of\nlike Google Maps for your neighborhood\nnow let's say your neighborhood looks\nlike this so your home is here and\nthere's a store here and another store\nhere and so on and there are some\nstreets too so these arrows show that\nthese are one-way streets there are a\nlot of one-way streets here and so for\nexample you can go from store to store B\nbut not the other way around and all the\nother lines here there are not arrows\nshow that they are two-way streets and\nlet's say that you already have each\nplace is coordinates there are latitudes\nand longitudes stored on your computer\nlike this as you can see from this table\nyou can tell that the latitude of home\nis forty-nine point two and the\nlongitude of home is minus one hundred\ntwenty three point four and so on now\nfrom this table like information you can\ntell where each location is exactly\nwhere each point is exactly but you\ncan't tell how these locations are\nconnected with streets and where the\nstreets are exactly so you need to\nfigure a way to store that information\nsomehow on your computer and there are\nactually a few different options for\nthis one of those options will be to\nstore all possible paths in a list like\nformat so for example one of those paths\nwill be from store a to home and another\none will be home to store a and yet\nanother path will be store a to store B\nand with that method your data might\nlook like this and from this list like\ninformation you can tell that as we saw\nearlier you can go from home to store a\nand from store a to home and home\nto store B and so on but you can't go\nfrom store B to home because this is a\none-way street and so there's no path\nfrom store B to home in this list okay\nso that's just one option another option\nmight be to list each of these places\nand for each of those places just list\nall the places you can go from that\nplace and with that method your data\nmight look like this instead as you can\nsee here we have table like information\nagain where on the left hand side we\nhave all the places listed home store a\nstore B school and then intersection\nthis one right here and on the right\nhand side for each of those places we\nhave all the places you can go from\nthere so from home you can go to store a\nstore B and intersection as you can see\nhere and from store a you can go to home\nor store B so these two methods are\nbasically two different ways of storing\nexactly the same set of data and as you\ncan see they have sort of different\nstructures and so these are simplified\nexamples of what data structures look\nlike now if you're already familiar with\ndata structures you might notice that\nthe first method corresponds to the\narray or a list data structure and the\nsecond method corresponds to the hash\ntable or hash map data structure okay so\nthat's one simple example of what data\nstructures are but this video series is\ncalled data structures and algorithms so\nwhat are algorithms one way to define\nwhat they are would be that there are\nthe operations we can perform on\ndifferent data structures and the sets\nof instructions for executing them so\none example here might be something like\nthis coming back to the previous example\nwe had let's say you want to find the\nshortest path from home to school so in\nthis problem by hand is pretty easy\npretty much right away you can see that\nthere are three potential paths from\nhome to school one of them is this one\njust go to store a store B and then\nschool another one is this one store B\nand this\ncool and another one the other one is\nfrom home to intersection to school and\nfor these three paths just compare the\ndistance that you need to travel for\neach of these paths and then pick the\nshortest one and to compute the distance\nthat you need to travel for each of\nthese paths you can for example use the\nlongitudes and latitudes the coordinates\nof each of these places and find the\ndistance in kilometers so solving this\nproblem by hand is pretty much trivial\nbut if you want to turn this into\nsomething a computer can understand you\nneed to be much more systematic about it\nso to make this strategy something a\ncomputer can understand easily you might\ncome up with a set of instructions like\nthis one first of all find all the\nplaces you can go from home so in this\nexample that's store a store B and then\nthe intersection and then from each of\nthose places find all the paths you can\ntake from that place so from store a you\ncan go to store B and from store B you\ncan go to school and from intersection\nyou can only go to school and as you go\nkeep track of the distance you've\ntraveled so far for each of those paths\nand keep repeating this process until\nyou get to the school then if you happen\nto find multiple paths that allows you\nto go from home to school then compare\nthe distance that you've traveled for\neach of those paths and finally find a\npath with the shortest distance traveled\nand then pick that as the shortest path\nokay so that's the result we were\nlooking for in the first place and this\nis a good example of what an algorithm\nis basically you have a problem you're\ngoing to solve in this case finding the\nshortest path from home to school and\nthen you have a set of systematic\ninstructions for solving that problem\nnow one thing to note here is that\ndepending on what data structure you're\nusing to store the data that you're\nperforming the algorithm on your\nalgorithm might look slightly\ndifferently you might even have in some\ncases completely different algorithms\nfor solving the same problem depending\non what data structure you're using\nin this particular example we talked\nabout two different options for storing\nthe information about where the streets\nare and how they connect different\nlocations the first option was to just\nlist all possible paths and remember\nthat the first step in our algorithm was\nto find all the possible places you can\ngo from home and to do that with the\nfirst stair structure this one right\nhere you might actually need to go\nthrough the entire list because in this\nparticular list we have three paths here\nfrom home but it's possible that we have\nanother path from home right here at the\nend of the list so you need to go\nthrough the entire list just in case on\nthe other hand if you use the second\ndata structure that we discussed we have\nall the possible places you can go from\nhome listed right here as a group so as\nsoon as we find the home row in this\ntable you won't need to go through the\nentire table anymore so in this\nparticular example using the second\nstructure actually makes it slightly\neasier to implement the algorithm that\nwe discussed now there are structures\nand algorithms are really important to\nlearn because they'll help you write\nefficient software as a software\ndeveloper so for example when I was\nworking at Microsoft as a data science\nintern I had to write this piece of code\nto retrieve some data and when I wrote\nit originally it was taking like seven\nto ten hours and basically it was too\nslow because we didn't want we didn't\nwant to wait that long so I rewrote it\nusing my knowledge of data structures\nand algorithms and after rewriting it\nthe new version only took like five to\nten minutes to load that data so that's\nwhy learning them is important and it's\nactually useful in many practical\nsituations that you might encounter as a\nsoftware developer - okay to give you an\neven better idea about what data\nstructures are like let me give you\nanother example here let's say you're\nhosting a party and you're expecting a\nbunch of people and this example is\ngonna be a little bit silly but just\nfollow along and you're gonna see why\nI'm talking about this particular\nexample anyway let's say that each\nperson\ncome to the party we'll bring sort of\nlike a small ball with them like a ball\nthat can fit in their hand and this ball\nwill have their name written on it so\nwhen David comes to the party he'll have\na ball with David written on it and when\nKevin arrives to the party he'll have a\nball with Kevin written on it and so on\nand this is just a silly little system\nthat you came up with for keeping track\nof who came to the party in which order\nbecause writing now each person's name\nwould be a lot of work you're just too\nbusy hosting a party so as someone who's\nstudying computer science let's say\nyou're trying to come up with an\nefficient system for storing these balls\nso that you can keep track of who came\nto the party one idea you have is this\none you get a very long box with 100\npartitions a lot of partitions and each\npartition let's say has exactly the same\nshape you know 10 centimeters by 10\ncentimeters let's say and every time\nsomeone comes to the party you're just\ngonna put that person's ball with their\nname written on it in the order they\ncame to the party so David's ball will\ncome in here and Kevin's will come in\nhere and so on and this is actually sort\nof like a data structure that's realized\nin real life and this actually\ncorresponds to the data structure called\narray in computer science and here's\nanother idea you have you get a bunch of\nboxes and this time instead of getting a\nlong box with many many partitions you\nwant to get individual boxes that are\nconnected with strings so the first box\nis connected to the second box with a\nstring and that's connected to the third\nbox with a string and so on and just\nlike before you want to put these tokens\nwith participants names written on them\nin these boxes just one by one in the\norder they came in so David's token will\ncome in here and Kevin's ball will come\nin here and so on and this sort of data\nstructure that's realized in real life\ncorresponds to the linked list data\nstructure in computer science okay so\nthe natural question here would be which\ndata structure\nuse for this party well it actually\ndepends because it highly depends on the\nparticular situation and the nature of\nthe party really and each data structure\nhas advantages and disadvantages okay\nthink about this situation let's say 100\npeople showed up to your party and\nyou're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly you realize that the 98th\nperson is Paul had been misspelled that\nperson's name had been misspelled so you\nwant to fix that with the array data\nstructure it's actually pretty easy you\njust need to find the 98th partition and\nthat exact location can be calculated\neasily because you know that each\npartition is ten centimeters wide so you\njust need to find ten centimeters times\nninety seven actually which is nine\nhundred seventy centimeters so you just\nneed to walk over from the beginning\nnine hundred seventy centimeters and\nthen you can find the 98th person's\ntoken pretty easily you just need to\nreplace that with the correct token with\nthe link list data structure though\ndoing the same thing would be slightly\nmore tricky and that's because finding\nthe 98th person or finding the 98th box\nhere would be much harder and the reason\nfor that is because these strings are\npretty soft and they can be pretty much\nany lengths so each box can be in any\nlocation relative to the previous box so\nthis first box might be in the living\nroom and the second box might be in the\nkitchen and so on so to find in 98th box\nwhat you need to do is you need to count\nthem one by one so you need to say okay\nthis is the first box and then this is\nthe second box and let's find the third\nbox fourth and so on until you get to\nthe 98th person at this point you might\nsay well the array data structure is a\nbetter one then well not necessarily so\nthink about this situation let's say you\nhave 100 people showing up to the party\nand you're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly five more people show up that\nyou didn't expect with the linked list\ndata structure it's pretty easy to deal\nwith that you can just\nadd five more boxes find five more boxes\nsomewhere and then five more strings and\njust add them to the last box you had in\nthe linked list data structure and then\nstore the five people's tokens in those\nboxes with the array data structure\nthough it's a little bit more tricky one\noption here would be to get another box\nwith let's say 100 partitions again and\nstore those people's tokens there and\nuse the two boxes together or you could\ndestroy the first box you had and then\nget a box with even more partitions\nlet's say 200 partitions and then\ntransfer all the balls you had for the\nfirst 100 people to the new box and then\nafter that add the additional five\npeople's tokens in the new box and in\ngeneral if you have no idea how many\npeople are coming to the party let's say\nanywhere between 5 to 1,000 people\nthe linked list data structure might be\nslightly more convenient than the array\nbecause linked lists are so much easier\nto resize than it is to resize a race ok\nand this was another simplified example\nof what data structures are like on a\ncomputer and this sort of gives you a\nrough idea about how to actually start\nthinking about them and throughout this\ncourse I'm going to introduce you to\neven more data structures and this time\nI'm going to explain them in a much more\ntechnical way using concepts like\nclasses objects memory and maybe even\nsome code snippets too now if you're\njust getting started with data\nstructures and algorithms one thing to\nkeep in mind that's actually really\nimportant is to apply what you've\nlearned through solving problems and the\nreason I say that is because it's so\ncommon for beginners to learn these\nconcepts and not actually be able to use\nthem in a real-world situation because\nthey haven't had enough practice and\nactually this video sponsor brilliant\norg has an interesting website for\nlearning these concepts in a sort of a\nnew way ok to show you what I mean let's\ntake a look at their computer science\nfundamentals course right\nhere which I would recommend for you\nguys and let's go into the intro to\nalgorithms section and you can see that\nit covers topics like arrays searching\ninsertion sort and Big O notation and in\nthe arrays section they have a bunch of\nexplanations about the topic and as you\ncontinue you'll give you a quiz to test\nyour understanding of the topic so it's\ndefinitely an interesting way to learn\ncomputer science concepts by solving\nproblems okay if you want to check it\nout for yourself just go to brilliant\norg slash CS no joke\nand going to this link will actually\nhelp support this channel and the first\n200 people will get 20% off the annual\nsubscription and actually I'm super\nexcited about this because they're the\nfirst sponsor I have on this YouTube\nchannel and I feel like I'm becoming a\nprofessional youtuber finally so thanks\nfor that brilliant ok as always I'm YK\nfrom CS dojo thanks for watching and\nI'll see you guys in the next video"

partition and\nthat exact location can be calculated\neasily because you know that each\npartition is ten centimeters wide so you\njust need to find ten centimeters times\nninety seven actually which is nine\nhundred seventy centimeters so you just\nneed to walk over from the beginning\nnine hundred seventy centimeters and\nthen you can find the 98th person's\ntoken pretty easily you just need to\nreplace that with the correct token with\nthe link list data structure though\ndoing the same thing would be slightly\nmore tricky and that's because finding\nthe 98th person or finding the 98th box\nhere would be much harder and the reason\nfor that is because these strings are\npretty soft and they can be pretty much\nany lengths so each box can be in any\nlocation relative to the previous box so\nthis first box might be in the living\nroom and the second box might be in the\nkitchen and so on so to find in 98th box\nwhat you need to do is you need to count\nthem one by one so you need to say okay\nthis is the first box and then this is\nthe second box and let's find the third\nbox fourth and so on until you get to\nthe 98th person at this point you might\nsay well the array data structure is a\nbetter one then well not necessarily so\nthink about this situation let's say you\nhave 100 people showing up to the party\nand you're pretty happy about it but\nsuddenly five more people show up that\nyou didn't expect with the linked list\ndata structure it's pretty easy to deal\nwith that you can just\nadd five more boxes find five more boxes\nsomewhere and then five more strings and\njust add them to the last box you had in\nthe linked list data structure and then\nstore the five people's tokens in those\nboxes with the array data structure\nthough it's a little bit more tricky one\noption here would be to get another box\nwith let's say 100 partitions again and\nstore those people's tokens there and\nuse the two boxes together or you could\ndestroy the first box you had and then\nget a box with even more partitions\nlet's say 200 partitions and then\ntransfer all the balls you had for the\nfirst 100 people to the new box and then\nafter that add the additional five\npeople's tokens in the new box and in\ngeneral if you have no idea how many\npeople are coming to the party let's say\nanywhere between 5 to 1,000 people\nthe linked list data structure might be\nslightly more convenient than the array\nbecause linked lists are so much easier\nto resize than it is to resize a race ok\nand this was another simplified example\nof what data structures are like on a\ncomputer and this sort of gives you a\nrough idea about how to actually start\nthinking about them and throughout this\ncourse I'm going to introduce you to\neven more data structures and this time\nI'm going to explain them in a much more\ntechnical way using concepts like\nclasses objects memory and maybe even\nsome code snippets too now if you're\njust getting started with data\nstructures and algorithms one thing to\nkeep in mind that's actually really\nimportant is to apply what you've\nlearned through solving problems and the\nreason I say that is because it's so\ncommon for beginners to learn these\nconcepts and not actually be able to use\nthem in a real-world situation because\nthey haven't had enough practice and\nactually this video sponsor brilliant\norg has an interesting website for\nlearning these concepts in a sort of a\nnew way ok to show you what I mean let's\ntake a look at their computer science\nfundamentals course right\nhere which I would recommend for you\nguys and let's go into the intro to\nalgorithms section and you can see that\nit covers topics like arrays searching\ninsertion sort and Big O notation and in\nthe arrays section they have a bunch of\nexplanations about the topic and as you\ncontinue you'll give you a quiz to test\nyour understanding of the topic so it's\ndefinitely an interesting way to learn\ncomputer science concepts by solving\nproblems okay if you want to check it\nout for yourself just go to brilliant\norg slash CS no joke\nand going to this link will actually\nhelp support this channel and the first\n200 people will get 20% off the annual\nsubscription and actually I'm super\nexcited about this because they're the\nfirst sponsor I have on this YouTube\nchannel and I feel like I'm becoming a\nprofessional youtuber finally so thanks\nfor that brilliant ok as always I'm YK\nfrom CS dojo thanks for watching and\nI'll see you guys in the next video"

Prompt generated: Generate notes for the following transcript in points: hello friends I'm going to start a
course on algorithms and whoever messes
up cake algorithm is a common subject
for computer science engineering
students most of the universities offer
this course as a part of syllabus and
this is a very cool subject and very
important subject and students face some
difficulties in some of the topics in
this one they could not understand them
very clearly so here I am going to make
the subject more and more simple so that
you can easily understand and even you
can practice that and also remember it
easily the importance of the subject is
that apart from theoretical examination
it is also important for competitive
exams and even programming contests most
of them are designed from this subject
only if any programming challenge is
there they mostly people come to
questions from this subject so this one
of the challenging subject for the
student because they get a chance to
solve different types of problems and
they give the strategy or approach for
solving the problem so some students
fail to understand it properly so they
could not get the approach for the
strategy for solving the problems and
they feel that they are lacking in the
logic development or strategy
development of a program so I'll be
covering in depth each and everything
right from the basics to the dead okay
so that you will be able to answer any
type of question from this forum I will
cover the topics such that just you look
at the question you can get asked that I
guarantee you right so the thing is I
will cover those points which are useful
for solving the motions some job
interviews or even for any other exam or
some entrance exams like eight exam the
cushions
thing from algorithms also what is also
one of the key subject there so you will
be able to answer any type of question
from there not all the lectures in the
order I'll be giving the numbers for
each topic so that you follow that order
you follow the sequence because I may be
breaking the major topic into small
topics and one more important leanness
your feedback is very important for me
because alchemy I have made for you
prepare few videos using presentations
and other tools but now I'm giving a
lecture on whiteboard so maybe i'm new
for the video quality and audio quality
all these things so technically once i
get set up so i need your feedback so i
can make my videos more and more better
so your feedback is important for me to
know how the video quality and other
quality you are getting it on your
devices because what i have checked on
different devices and i found that the
results are different so what because
you are using what i should improve
voice or what so any of your feedback
let us start with just introduction what
is the main part on what is the length
autumn why this return when it is
written who will write it let us get
answers forties see algorithm as a
definition it's a common definition
everybody knows that it's a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem yes it is a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem then what is the program program
is also establish the procedure for
solving a problem then what is the
difference between program and Anegada
so by comparing program and Elgort or I
can make you understand the importance
for the meaning of a god let us take it
here's an angora and here's a program
let us see the first thing first
difference if you know the software
development lifecycle means the phases
of developing a software project in the
phases of development of the project
there are two important phases design
phase and the implementation phase if
you are not aware of it let me get you
whatever you want to manufacture or
construct something by engineering
procedures then for step one if one of
the important step is designing first
you know designing make your design
perfect and thorough so that you can
understand what you are going to
construct what you are going to develop
and here near sure what you are going to
develop then you start the development
you can't develop anything you cannot
construct anything on trial and error
basis like you construct there's
something naughty endomorphs wrong
destroyed and I get create a new one so
no but it is easy easy in software
engineering software engineer can write
some program and change the mind delete
the program and again started in over
there so that's why we cannot get the
feeling that we have this set amount so
much amount of time in writing so
useless program so the point is first
you design and then you write the
program so at the design time what do
you use so you're not reading a program
then what do you write so that same
program we write it in simple English
like statements that are easy to
understand without using proper syntax
and we may not be ready
machine that is not computer remember I
came on paper or even if you're using a
machine also then you will not be
writing in some language you can you be
writing in ms word or notepad like
application so just you are getting
familiar how your program going to work
so that's nothing but an algorithm so
algorithm sorry is written at design
time and when the programs are done they
are internet implementation time the
design time an implementation time so
first you make a design what your
procedures going to do what your
software is going to do come up with
some design and that design your program
then what do you call the person who who
designing whatever program where doesn't
that yes if programmer is capable of
doing that he can do it otherwise the
person who will do this one should have
the domain knowledge the problems
knowledge knowledge about the
problematic solution
he can give a solution the one who
understand the problem and has the
domain knowledge
suppose you are developing a software or
a network come on a program for account
the accountant can understand accounting
better or if you are writing an
application or develop an application
for hospital then doctors of the
administrative staff of an Hospital
canvass and the system better than a
programmer so mostly the one who is
having a knowledge about the domain for
which the application is being developed
they can write on that so the person who
I should have
domain knowledge who would like to
program program so programmers can also
have the mid knowledge they can also
have the mandamus that he is acting as a
designer and here he is acting as a
programmer thanks what is the language
used for writing algorithm you can use
any language any language any English
language or you can use some
mathematical rotations if you are ready
English let language it will be like
reading power or somebody but don't
write if you can if you want you can use
mathematical notations also expect I
refuse mathematical notations so a
language have you used any language
means English language or some
mathematical notations can be use as
long as it is understandable by those
people who are using it like if a
designer has written an algorithm that
the programmer will be right in a
program fire so designers should
understand and also programmers should
understand that one right so the team of
programmers who are working on that
project should be able to understand it
then this is written only using
programming language like C C++ Java
Python right so you can use different
languages for developing a program the
next one more important thing is when
you write an algorithm is going to be
hardware and software means operating
system independent it's not dependent on
hardware what's machine you are going to
use what is the configuration of the
she were to the operating system me that
the Linux operating system or Windows
operating system we don't bother about
it but when you write the program it is
a dependent on hardware and operating
system so any other program you have to
sell it some hardware I'll be showing to
them and also you have to select some
operating system you may be doing it for
Linux or you will be need for Windows so
the method will be different and the
environment side-effect so is the
important the next after adding an
algorithm we analyze an imaginary part
on means you will study them to find out
are perfectly normal and our algorithm
is efficient or not in terms of time and
space we will see what does it mean by
now and access so we will analyze an
airport what do we do with the program
so you don't have to study the program
already program is there just run it and
check it so we don't
testing testing of the programs that's
it these are few differences between
algorithm and program these differences
will be help you understand what our
algorithms alright now one more thing I
will tell you the syntax of the language
that we use any language can be use but
who actually write algorithms and who
use them and who write the programs of
programmers who are coming from
university graduates mostly Union City
graduate knows at least C language so
note is mostly in the name of algorithm
we write C language program only so the
benefit is better and what is that
everybody knows C language now so
instead of reading some other language
to confuse we can use C language movie
so that everybody can understand so even
at a school level C language is being
taught so everybody
so emergency language so I don't using C
language syntax for it in algorithms

Prompt generated: Generate notes for the following transcript in points: hello friends I'm going to start a
course on algorithms and whoever messes
up cake algorithm is a common subject
for computer science engineering
students most of the universities offer
this course as a part of syllabus and
this is a very cool subject and very
important subject and students face some
difficulties in some of the topics in
this one they could not understand them
very clearly so here I am going to make
the subject more and more simple so that
you can easily understand and even you
can practice that and also remember it
easily the importance of the subject is
that apart from theoretical examination
it is also important for competitive
exams and even programming contests most
of them are designed from this subject
only if any programming challenge is
there they mostly people come to
questions from this subject so this one
of the challenging subject for the
student because they get a chance to
solve different types of problems and
they give the strategy or approach for
solving the problem so some students
fail to understand it properly so they
could not get the approach for the
strategy for solving the problems and
they feel that they are lacking in the
logic development or strategy
development of a program so I'll be
covering in depth each and everything
right from the basics to the dead okay
so that you will be able to answer any
type of question from this forum I will
cover the topics such that just you look
at the question you can get asked that I
guarantee you right so the thing is I
will cover those points which are useful
for solving the motions some job
interviews or even for any other exam or
some entrance exams like eight exam the
cushions
thing from algorithms also what is also
one of the key subject there so you will
be able to answer any type of question
from there not all the lectures in the
order I'll be giving the numbers for
each topic so that you follow that order
you follow the sequence because I may be
breaking the major topic into small
topics and one more important leanness
your feedback is very important for me
because alchemy I have made for you
prepare few videos using presentations
and other tools but now I'm giving a
lecture on whiteboard so maybe i'm new
for the video quality and audio quality
all these things so technically once i
get set up so i need your feedback so i
can make my videos more and more better
so your feedback is important for me to
know how the video quality and other
quality you are getting it on your
devices because what i have checked on
different devices and i found that the
results are different so what because
you are using what i should improve
voice or what so any of your feedback
let us start with just introduction what
is the main part on what is the length
autumn why this return when it is
written who will write it let us get
answers forties see algorithm as a
definition it's a common definition
everybody knows that it's a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem yes it is a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem then what is the program program
is also establish the procedure for
solving a problem then what is the
difference between program and Anegada
so by comparing program and Elgort or I
can make you understand the importance
for the meaning of a god let us take it
here's an angora and here's a program
let us see the first thing first
difference if you know the software
development lifecycle means the phases
of developing a software project in the
phases of development of the project
there are two important phases design
phase and the implementation phase if
you are not aware of it let me get you
whatever you want to manufacture or
construct something by engineering
procedures then for step one if one of
the important step is designing first
you know designing make your design
perfect and thorough so that you can
understand what you are going to
construct what you are going to develop
and here near sure what you are going to
develop then you start the development
you can't develop anything you cannot
construct anything on trial and error
basis like you construct there's
something naughty endomorphs wrong
destroyed and I get create a new one so
no but it is easy easy in software
engineering software engineer can write
some program and change the mind delete
the program and again started in over
there so that's why we cannot get the
feeling that we have this set amount so
much amount of time in writing so
useless program so the point is first
you design and then you write the
program so at the design time what do
you use so you're not reading a program
then what do you write so that same
program we write it in simple English
like statements that are easy to
understand without using proper syntax
and we may not be ready
machine that is not computer remember I
came on paper or even if you're using a
machine also then you will not be
writing in some language you can you be
writing in ms word or notepad like
application so just you are getting
familiar how your program going to work
so that's nothing but an algorithm so
algorithm sorry is written at design
time and when the programs are done they
are internet implementation time the
design time an implementation time so
first you make a design what your
procedures going to do what your
software is going to do come up with
some design and that design your program
then what do you call the person who who
designing whatever program where doesn't
that yes if programmer is capable of
doing that he can do it otherwise the
person who will do this one should have
the domain knowledge the problems
knowledge knowledge about the
problematic solution
he can give a solution the one who
understand the problem and has the
domain knowledge
suppose you are developing a software or
a network come on a program for account
the accountant can understand accounting
better or if you are writing an
application or develop an application
for hospital then doctors of the
administrative staff of an Hospital
canvass and the system better than a
programmer so mostly the one who is
having a knowledge about the domain for
which the application is being developed
they can write on that so the person who
I should have
domain knowledge who would like to
program program so programmers can also
have the mid knowledge they can also
have the mandamus that he is acting as a
designer and here he is acting as a
programmer thanks what is the language
used for writing algorithm you can use
any language any language any English
language or you can use some
mathematical rotations if you are ready
English let language it will be like
reading power or somebody but don't
write if you can if you want you can use
mathematical notations also expect I
refuse mathematical notations so a
language have you used any language
means English language or some
mathematical notations can be use as
long as it is understandable by those
people who are using it like if a
designer has written an algorithm that
the programmer will be right in a
program fire so designers should
understand and also programmers should
understand that one right so the team of
programmers who are working on that
project should be able to understand it
then this is written only using
programming language like C C++ Java
Python right so you can use different
languages for developing a program the
next one more important thing is when
you write an algorithm is going to be
hardware and software means operating
system independent it's not dependent on
hardware what's machine you are going to
use what is the configuration of the
she were to the operating system me that
the Linux operating system or Windows
operating system we don't bother about
it but when you write the program it is
a dependent on hardware and operating
system so any other program you have to
sell it some hardware I'll be showing to
them and also you have to select some
operating system you may be doing it for
Linux or you will be need for Windows so
the method will be different and the
environment side-effect so is the
important the next after adding an
algorithm we analyze an imaginary part
on means you will study them to find out
are perfectly normal and our algorithm
is efficient or not in terms of time and
space we will see what does it mean by
now and access so we will analyze an
airport what do we do with the program
so you don't have to study the program
already program is there just run it and
check it so we don't
testing testing of the programs that's
it these are few differences between
algorithm and program these differences
will be help you understand what our
algorithms alright now one more thing I
will tell you the syntax of the language
that we use any language can be use but
who actually write algorithms and who
use them and who write the programs of
programmers who are coming from
university graduates mostly Union City
graduate knows at least C language so
note is mostly in the name of algorithm
we write C language program only so the
benefit is better and what is that
everybody knows C language now so
instead of reading some other language
to confuse we can use C language movie
so that everybody can understand so even
at a school level C language is being
taught so everybody
so emergency language so I don't using C
language syntax for it in algorithms

cover the topics such that just you look
at the question you can get asked that I
guarantee you right so the thing is I
will cover those points which are useful
for solving the motions some job
interviews or even for any other exam or
some entrance exams like eight exam the
cushions
thing from algorithms also what is also
one of the key subject there so you will
be able to answer any type of question
from there not all the lectures in the
order I'll be giving the numbers for
each topic so that you follow that order
you follow the sequence because I may be
breaking the major topic into small
topics and one more important leanness
your feedback is very important for me
because alchemy I have made for you
prepare few videos using presentations
and other tools but now I'm giving a
lecture on whiteboard so maybe i'm new
for the video quality and audio quality
all these things so technically once i
get set up so i need your feedback so i
can make my videos more and more better
so your feedback is important for me to
know how the video quality and other
quality you are getting it on your
devices because what i have checked on
different devices and i found that the
results are different so what because
you are using what i should improve
voice or what so any of your feedback
let us start with just introduction what
is the main part on what is the length
autumn why this return when it is
written who will write it let us get
answers forties see algorithm as a
definition it's a common definition
everybody knows that it's a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem yes it is a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem then what is the program program
is also establish the procedure for
solving a problem then what is the
difference between program and Anegada
so by comparing program and Elgort or I
can make you understand the importance
for the meaning of a god let us take it
here's an angora and here's a program
let us see the first thing first
difference if you know the software
development lifecycle means the phases
of developing a software project in the
phases of development of the project
there are two important phases design
phase and the implementation phase if
you are not aware of it let me get you
whatever you want to manufacture or
construct something by engineering
procedures then for step one if one of
the important step is designing first
you know designing make your design
perfect and thorough so that you can
understand what you are going to
construct what you are going to develop
and here near sure what you are going to
develop then you start the development
you can't develop anything you cannot
construct anything on trial and error
basis like you construct there's
something naughty endomorphs wrong
destroyed and I get create a new one so
no but it is easy easy in software
engineering software engineer can write
some program and change the mind delete
the program and again started in over
there so that's why we cannot get the
feeling that we have this set amount so
much amount of time in writing so
useless program so the point is first
you design and then you write the
program so at the design time what do
you use so you're not reading a program
then what do you write so that same
program we write it in simple English
like statements that are easy to
understand without using proper syntax
and we may not be ready
machine that is not computer remember I
came on paper or even if you're using a
machine also then you will not be
writing in some language you can you be
writing in ms word or notepad like
application so just you are getting
familiar how your program going to work
so that's nothing but an algorithm so
algorithm sorry is written at design
time and when the programs are done they
are internet implementation time the
design time an implementation time so
first you make a design what your
procedures going to do what your
software is going to do come up with
some design and that design your program
then what do you call the person who who
designing whatever program where doesn't
that yes if programmer is capable of
doing that he can do it otherwise the
person who will do this one should have
the domain knowledge the problems
knowledge knowledge about the
problematic solution
he can give a solution the one who
understand the problem and has the
domain knowledge
suppose you are developing a software or
a network come on a program for account
the accountant can understand accounting
better or if you are writing an
application or develop an application
for hospital then doctors of the
administrative staff of an Hospital
canvass and the system better than a
programmer so mostly the one who is
having a knowledge about the domain for
which the application is being developed
they can write on that so the person who
I should have
domain knowledge who would like to
program program so programmers can also
have the mid knowledge they can also
have the mandamus that he is acting as a
designer and here he is acting as a
programmer thanks what is the language
used for writing algorithm you can use
any language any language any English
language or you can use some
mathematical rotations if you are ready
English let language it will be like
reading power or somebody but don't
write if you can if you want you can use
mathematical notations also expect I
refuse mathematical notations so a
language have you used any language
means English language or some
mathematical notations can be use as
long as it is understandable by those
people who are using it like if a
designer has written an algorithm that
the programmer will be right in a
program fire so designers should
understand and also programmers should
understand that one right so the team of
programmers who are working on that
project should be able to understand it
then this is written only using
programming language like C C++ Java
Python right so you can use different
languages for developing a program the
next one more important thing is when
you write an algorithm is going to be
hardware and software means operating
system independent it's not dependent on
hardware what's machine you are going to
use what is the configuration of the
she were to the operating system me that
the Linux operating system or Windows
operating system we don't bother about
it but when you write the program it is
a dependent on hardware and operating
system so any other program you have to
sell it some hardware I'll be showing to
them and also you have to select some
operating system you may be doing it for
Linux or you will be need for Windows so
the method will be different and the
environment side-effect so is the
important the next after adding an
algorithm we analyze an imaginary part
on means you will study them to find out
are perfectly normal and our algorithm
is efficient or not in terms of time and
space we will see what does it mean by
now and access so we will analyze an
airport what do we do with the program
so you don't have to study the program
already program is there just run it and
check it so we don't
testing testing of the programs that's
it these are few differences between
algorithm and program these differences
will be help you understand what our
algorithms alright now one more thing I
will tell you the syntax of the language
that we use any language can be use but
who actually write algorithms and who
use them and who write the programs of
programmers who are coming from
university graduates mostly Union City
graduate knows at least C language so
note is mostly in the name of algorithm
we write C language program only so the
benefit is better and what is that
everybody knows C language now so
instead of reading some other language
to confuse we can use C language movie
so that everybody can understand so even
at a school level C language is being
taught so everybody
so emergency language so I don't using C
language syntax for it in algorithms

Prompt generated: Generate notes for the following transcript in points: hello friends I'm going to start a
course on algorithms and whoever messes
up cake algorithm is a common subject
for computer science engineering
students most of the universities offer
this course as a part of syllabus and
this is a very cool subject and very
important subject and students face some
difficulties in some of the topics in
this one they could not understand them
very clearly so here I am going to make
the subject more and more simple so that
you can easily understand and even you
can practice that and also remember it
easily the importance of the subject is
that apart from theoretical examination
it is also important for competitive
exams and even programming contests most
of them are designed from this subject
only if any programming challenge is
there they mostly people come to
questions from this subject so this one
of the challenging subject for the
student because they get a chance to
solve different types of problems and
they give the strategy or approach for
solving the problem so some students
fail to understand it properly so they
could not get the approach for the
strategy for solving the problems and
they feel that they are lacking in the
logic development or strategy
development of a program so I'll be
covering in depth each and everything
right from the basics to the dead okay
so that you will be able to answer any
type of question from this forum I will
cover the topics such that just you look
at the question you can get asked that I
guarantee you right so the thing is I
will cover those points which are useful
for solving the motions some job
interviews or even for any other exam or
some entrance exams like eight exam the
cushions
thing from algorithms also what is also
one of the key subject there so you will
be able to answer any type of question
from there not all the lectures in the
order I'll be giving the numbers for
each topic so that you follow that order
you follow the sequence because I may be
breaking the major topic into small
topics and one more important leanness
your feedback is very important for me
because alchemy I have made for you
prepare few videos using presentations
and other tools but now I'm giving a
lecture on whiteboard so maybe i'm new
for the video quality and audio quality
all these things so technically once i
get set up so i need your feedback so i
can make my videos more and more better
so your feedback is important for me to
know how the video quality and other
quality you are getting it on your
devices because what i have checked on
different devices and i found that the
results are different so what because
you are using what i should improve
voice or what so any of your feedback
let us start with just introduction what
is the main part on what is the length
autumn why this return when it is
written who will write it let us get
answers forties see algorithm as a
definition it's a common definition
everybody knows that it's a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem yes it is a step by step
procedure for solving a computational
problem then what is the program program
is also establish the procedure for
solving a problem then what is the
difference between program and Anegada
so by comparing program and Elgort or I
can make you understand the importance
for the meaning of a god let us take it
here's an angora and here's a program
let us see the first thing first
difference if you know the software
development lifecycle means the phases
of developing a software project in the
phases of development of the project
there are two important phases design
phase and the implementation phase if
you are not aware of it let me get you
whatever you want to manufacture or
construct something by engineering
procedures then for step one if one of
the important step is designing first
you know designing make your design
perfect and thorough so that you can
understand what you are going to
construct what you are going to develop
and here near sure what you are going to
develop then you start the development
you can't develop anything you cannot
construct anything on trial and error
basis like you construct there's
something naughty endomorphs wrong
destroyed and I get create a new one so
no but it is easy easy in software
engineering software engineer can write
some program and change the mind delete
the program and again started in over
there so that's why we cannot get the
feeling that we have this set amount so
much amount of time in writing so
useless program so the point is first
you design and then you write the
program so at the design time what do
you use so you're not reading a program
then what do you write so that same
program we write it in simple English
like statements that are easy to
understand without using proper syntax
and we may not be ready
machine that is not computer remember I
came on paper or even if you're using a
machine also then you will not be
writing in some language you can you be
writing in ms word or notepad like
application so just you are getting
familiar how your program going to work
so that's nothing but an algorithm so
algorithm sorry is written at design
time and when the programs are done they
are internet implementation time the
design time an implementation time so
first you make a design what your
procedures going to do what your
software is going to do come up with
some design and that design your program
then what do you call the person who who
designing whatever program where doesn't
that yes if programmer is capable of
doing that he can do it otherwise the
person who will do this one should have
the domain knowledge the problems
knowledge knowledge about the
problematic solution
he can give a solution the one who
understand the problem and has the
domain knowledge
suppose you are developing a software or
a network come on a program for account
the accountant can understand accounting
better or if you are writing an
application or develop an application
for hospital then doctors of the
administrative staff of an Hospital
canvass and the system better than a
programmer so mostly the one who is
having a knowledge about the domain for
which the application is being developed
they can write on that so the person who
I should have
domain knowledge who would like to
program program so programmers can also
have the mid knowledge they can also
have the mandamus that he is acting as a
designer and here he is acting as a
programmer thanks what is the language
used for writing algorithm you can use
any language any language any English
language or you can use some
mathematical rotations if you are ready
English let language it will be like
reading power or somebody but don't
write if you can if you want you can use
mathematical notations also expect I
refuse mathematical notations so a
language have you used any language
means English language or some
mathematical notations can be use as
long as it is understandable by those
people who are using it like if a
designer has written an algorithm that
the programmer will be right in a
program fire so designers should
understand and also programmers should
understand that one right so the team of
programmers who are working on that
project should be able to understand it
then this is written only using
programming language like C C++ Java
Python right so you can use different
languages for developing a program the
next one more important thing is when
you write an algorithm is going to be
hardware and software means operating
system independent it's not dependent on
hardware what's machine you are going to
use what is the configuration of the
she were to the operating system me that
the Linux operating system or Windows
operating system we don't bother about
it but when you write the program it is
a dependent on hardware and operating
system so any other program you have to
sell it some hardware I'll be showing to
them and also you have to select some
operating system you may be doing it for
Linux or you will be need for Windows so
the method will be different and the
environment side-effect so is the
important the next after adding an
algorithm we analyze an imaginary part
on means you will study them to find out
are perfectly normal and our algorithm
is efficient or not in terms of time and
space we will see what does it mean by
now and access so we will analyze an
airport what do we do with the program
so you don't have to study the program
already program is there just run it and
check it so we don't
testing testing of the programs that's
it these are few differences between
algorithm and program these differences
will be help you understand what our
algorithms alright now one more thing I
will tell you the syntax of the language
that we use any language can be use but
who actually write algorithms and who
use them and who write the programs of
programmers who are coming from
university graduates mostly Union City
graduate knows at least C language so
note is mostly in the name of algorithm
we write C language program only so the
benefit is better and what is that
everybody knows C language now so
instead of reading some other language
to confuse we can use C language movie
so that everybody can understand so even
at a school level C language is being
taught so everybody
so emergency language so I don't using C
language syntax for it in algorithms

    *   Need information on how the videos are playing on different devices.

**What is an Algorithm?**

*   **Definition:** A step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem.

**Algorithm vs. Program:**

*   **Key Difference:** The context in which they are used.
*   **Design vs. Implementation:**
    *   Algorithms are written during the design phase of software development.
    *   Programs are written during the implementation phase.
*   **Algorithm Characteristics:**
    *   Written in simple English-like statements (or mathematical notations).
    *   Aimed at human understanding (not necessarily machine-readable).
*   **Program Characteristics:**
    *   Written in a programming language (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python).
    *   Meant to be executed by a computer.
*   **Who Writes Them?**
    *   Algorithms: Designed by someone with domain knowledge (e.g., an accountant for accounting software, a doctor for hospital software). Programmers can also act as designers.
    *   Programs: Written by programmers.
*   **Language Used:**
    *   Algorithms: Can use any understandable language, English, or mathematical notation.
    *   Programs: Use specific programming languages with defined syntax.

*   **Course Structure:**
    *   Lectures will be numbered for easy sequential learning.
    *   Larger topics may be broken down into smaller, manageable segments.
*   **Feedback:**
    *   Feedback is crucial for improving video and audio quality.
    *   Need information on how the videos are playing on different devices.

**What is an Algorithm?**

*   **Definition:** A step-by-step procedure for solving a computational problem.

**Algorithm vs. Program:**

*   **Key Difference:** The context in which they are used.
*   **Design vs. Implementation:**
    *   Algorithms are written during the design phase of software development.
    *   Programs are written during the implementation phase.
*   **Algorithm Characteristics:**
    *   Written in simple English-like statements (or mathematical notations).
    *   Aimed at human understanding (not necessarily machine-readable).
*   **Program Characteristics:**
    *   Written in a programming language (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python).
    *   Meant to be executed by a computer.
*   **Who Writes Them?**
    *   Algorithms: Designed by someone with domain knowledge (e.g., an accountant for accounting software, a doctor for hospital software). Programmers can also act as designers.
    *   Programs: Written by programmers.
*   **Language Used:**
    *   Algorithms: Can use any understandable language, English, or mathematical notation.
    *   Programs: Use specific programming languages with defined syntax.
*   **Hardware/Software Dependence:**
    *   Algorithms: Hardware and operating system independent.
    *   Programs: Dependent on specific hardware and operating systems.
*   **Analysis vs. Testing:**
    *   Algorithms: Analyzed for correctness and efficiency (time and space).
    *   Programs: Tested to ensure they function correctly.

**Additional Points:**

*   **Algorithm Syntax:**
    *   C language syntax will be used for algorithms in this course.
    *   Reason: Most computer science graduates are familiar with C.
*   **C language usage:** Using C language makes algorithms accessible to a wider audience.
